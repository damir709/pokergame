    Hello and welcome to poker by Damir! 
    Hopefully by the time you are reading this,
    the game will be fully functional and not able to be broken.

    <br>Issues encountered:
</h1>
<h4 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
    issue: deck was not shuffling with function being called properly
    <br>
    fix: changed ">" to "<"  in "for(i = 0; i < 999; i++)" shuffle function
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    fix: added for loop restriction
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: chips added to pot are added as strings, not values
    <br>
    fix: converted chips string to a number
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    issue: unexpected end of input from hell 
    <br>

    <br>

    issue: could not access 'numberOfBurnedCards' before initialization
    <br>
    fix: moved initialization of variables outside function
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: the "you draw x cards" log always appears, even when drawing no cards
    <br>
    fix: nested drawing cards statements within a different else loop block
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: being able to bet characters, making player and pot chipcounts NaN
    <br>
    fix: added isNaN() to if statement
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: raising opponent would cause opponent to loop betting 100 chips
    <br>
    fix: moved break statement to outside if statement block
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: opponent always bets, even if a prompt is entered incorrectly
    <br>
    fix: removed break statement from within if statement block
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: raising or matching the opponent skips the player discard phase
    <br>
    fix: changed gameState value in raise and match statements from 3 to 2
    <br>
    <br>
    issue: could not discard face cards after fixing discard hand logic
